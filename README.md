7. üß™ Testing the Setup

    1. Generated Load
        - Used [Loader.io](https://loader.io/)
        - Example: 1000 users for 1 minutes
        - Screenshot 25

    2. Monitoring Metrics
        - Went to CloudWatch ‚Üí Metrics ‚Üí AWS/ApplicationELB ‚Üí Per AppELB Metrics
        - Looked for `RequestCount` metric on my ALB

    3. Verified Results
        - Checked Lambda logs in CloudWatch. The load was high continuously so it spawned 2 instances
        - Checked EC2 console for new/terminated instances. 2 New instances Created
        - Checked email for SNS alerts. Received 4 Notifications, first 2 for Upscaling and last 2 for downscaling
        - At last there were no instances with the TAG_VALUE `GunAutoScaled` so it just said Load is within Acceptable limits. No upscaling or downscaling needed
    4. Screenshots 26 through 38

8. üß© Extras To use [Loader.io](https://loader.io/)
    1. Signed Up
    2. Added my ALB uri as host
    3. Then it asked to put up a file on my server
    4. Created that file on the EC2 instance(created and attached in target group)
    5. Then installed nginx on the EC2 instance and put that file in /var/www/html
    6. Then ran the ALB uri in the Browser
    7. When the content got displayed on the browser, my ALB uri was verified as host
    8. Then created a test and tested my app for Load
